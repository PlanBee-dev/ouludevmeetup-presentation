# What was built?

We wanted to create a simple and easy to use site to organize local developer meetups in our town. So requirements were quite simple. 

- üìù **(Mostly) static site** - Not much funcitonality should be needed
- üé® **Open source** - Anyone can add a meetup by creating a PR in github
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Yes, some functionality** - Anyone can create a PR for meetup via form in site

# Astro


For building blazingly fast content sites.

Generates static html from content like markdown, same way for example like Gatsby or Next.js. 
However Astro is much simpler and lighter.

Can be used with any framework like React or Vue but also works without any framework for simple sites. Like this one we made.

# pnpm

Package manager

Supports monorepos out of the box and is fast. pnpm uses hard links instead of copying dependencies which makes installs very fast.


<style>
.footnotes-sep {
  @apply mt-20 opacity-10;
}
.footnotes {
  @apply text-sm opacity-75;
}
.footnote-backref {
  display: none;
}
</style>

# Tailwind


For fast styling for wooden eyed developers like me.

Use utility classes for styles.

We used also premade components for common things like cards, navbars etc.

# Github pages

For hosting static sites for free.

Simply the easiest way. 

We deploy the built site to the `gh-pages` branch which github hosts for us at https://planbee-dev.github.io/oulu-dev-meetups

# Github actions

Automating workflows

Used for automating issue and PR creation and deployment workflows.

[Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

# Cloudflare workers

For backend

We used workers to connect our form to github issue creating. The form submits to a worker which then creates an issue in github using Octokit API.

# Octokit

Github's official library for managing GitHub interactions like repositories, issues, pull requests etc. 

Used to create issues for meetups in markdown format to GitHub repository.

```
    const createIssueRes = await octokit.rest.issues.create({
      owner: props.env.GITHUB_REPO_OWNER,
      repo: props.env.GITHUB_REPO_NAME,
      labels: ['meetup'],
      title: props.meetup.title,
      body: getMeetupIssueBody(props.meetup),
    }); 
```
